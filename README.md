# Electricity-Bill-Generator
This project features an HTML form for collecting electricity bill data, calculates the bill amount based on the input, and uses PHP to connect to a database. The PHP scripts manage the storage of the calculated bill amount and user information in the database.

We maintain three files for managing electricity bill data:

HTML Electricity Bill Form: Gathers bill data and calculates the bill amount.
Database Connection (PHP): Connects to the database.
Data Storage (PHP): Stores the calculated bill data in the database.
